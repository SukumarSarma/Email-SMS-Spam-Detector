## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Freshers and i love in the field of data science, Machine learning and Data Analyst and i had done 6 month of internship in Machine Learning field. I used to have a creative thinking with the real world problem and try to analize it and try to implement it.

  
# Email/SMS Spam Detector

This Web app can predict the Email/SMS as Spam or Not Spam.


## How it Work

 I had taken dataset called SMSSpamCollection and by the use of Natural Language Processing with Bag of Words i trained the model with Multinomial Naive Byes classifier and after tesing i got with 98% accuracy with also good precision.
 Then i made a pickle file for bag of words and Multinomial Naive Byes classifier to import into streamlit so that from that pickle file i can run directly of the user entered Email/SMS text data and then creating web app framework by streamlit and finally deployed a web app Machine Learning Model by using heroku cloud platform.

- Install Pycharm and Install Streamlit 

- import those pickle files and create all the necessary requirement for web app like button and text box etc 

- Run the user text input and output the preicted result for weather the Message is Spam/ham.
